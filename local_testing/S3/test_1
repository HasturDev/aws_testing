    Task: Create an AWS S3 Bucket.

    This function is a placeholder for the code needed to create an S3 bucket in AWS.
    You should use the boto3 library to interact with AWS and create the bucket.

    Steps:
    1. Import the boto3 library.
    2. Create an S3 client using boto3.client('s3').
    3. Use the client to create a new S3 bucket. You can use the 'create_bucket' method.
       Make sure to handle the bucket naming conventions and specify the correct region.

    Task: Create an S3 Bucket within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

    This function should outline the steps to create an S3 bucket that is associated with a VPC.
    Note: S3 buckets are global and not tied to VPCs directly. However, you can control access
    to the bucket from specific VPCs using bucket policies or VPC endpoints.

    Steps:
    1. Create a VPC or use an existing VPC in AWS.
    2. Set up a VPC Endpoint for S3 within the VPC.
    3. Create an S3 bucket using the create_s3_bucket function or similar logic.
    4. Update the S3 bucket policy to restrict access to the VPC endpoint or use a bucket policy
       to allow access from the VPC.

    Task: Create an S3 Bucket and associate it with a specific subnet in a VPC.

    As with the second function, remember that S3 buckets are not directly tied to subnets.
    This function will focus on setting up network configurations so that the bucket
    is accessible from a particular subnet.

    Steps:
    1. Create or identify a VPC and its subnet where the bucket should be accessible.
    2. Create a VPC Endpoint for S3 in the specified subnet.
    3. Create an S3 bucket.
    4. Update the bucket policy or use network ACLs to control the traffic from the subnet
       to the S3 bucket through the VPC Endpoint.

def connect_s3_bucket_to_internet():

    Task: Adjust settings to allow an S3 Bucket within a VPC subnet to connect to the public internet.

    This operation mainly involves configuring network settings to ensure that the S3 bucket,
    while being accessed primarily within a VPC subnet, can also interact with the public internet.

    Steps:
    1. Ensure that the S3 bucket has a public policy allowing it to be accessed from the internet.
    2. Configure the VPC's Internet Gateway and route tables to allow outbound internet traffic.
    3. Adjust the Network ACLs and Security Groups to allow the necessary traffic between the S3 bucket
       and the internet.
    4. If using VPC Endpoints, ensure they are configured to allow access from the public internet,
       if required.
